# Introduction

The Wasa Kredit B2B checkout is a streamlined and easy way to offer Wasa Kreditâ€™s financial products on an e-commerce site. 
Currently, we are offering leasing, rental or invoice as a payment method. Additional, forthcoming financial products are in the roadmap ahead. 
The checkout provides an automated customer journey and agreement signing is done with BankID.
