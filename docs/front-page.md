# Introduction

The Wasa Kredit B2B checkout is a streamlined and easy way to offer Wasa Kreditâ€™s financial products on an e-commerce site. 
Currently, we are offering leasing or rental as a payment method. Additional, forthcoming financial products are in the roadmap ahead. 
The checkout provides an automated customer journey and leasing agreement signing is done with BankID.

There are three main approaches for integrating the checkout service:

## Platform

At present, we provide an extension to one open source e-commerce platform. Please feel free to contact us with suggestions 
for future supported platforms.

Magento 1.x

## SDK

At the moment we offer a PHP SDK to facilitate and speed up your integration process. Additional SDKs for common languages 
will be provided in the near future.

PHP SDK

Planned SDK

.net SDK

## API

Besides using the SDKs, it is also possible to integrate using a REST API. This API offers a selection of carefully chosen 
endpoints and operations necessary for integrating with the checkout as well as peripheral services and components, such 
as a product leasing price widget.
